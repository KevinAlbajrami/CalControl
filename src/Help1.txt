WHAT IS YOUR BMR?
Your BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) is an estimate of how many calories you'd burn if you were to do nothing but rest for 24 hours. It represents the minimum amount of energy needed to keep your body functioning, including breathing and keeping your heart beating.
Your BMR does not include the calories you burn from normal daily activities or exercise.

Our calculator uses the Mifflin-St. Jeor equations to estimate your BMR which is believed to be more accurate than the more commonly used Harris-Benedict equation.

WHY ARE CALORIES IMPORTANT?
Calories are units of energy, contained within food, and used by the human body to maintain daily health and life. Calories are associated with energy that is contained in protein, carbohydrates and fat. Within each of these measures, calories will have a given amount of energy available.  Different foods will provide different amounts of calories. In addition to this, the other nutrients needed for the human body will also differ according to the foods being eaten.

The human body will burn calories in order to remain healthy and balanced. This is by the metabolism moving calories through your body. Your metabolism may also turn calories into proteins or amino acids if the body needs it. These calories then move into the bloodstream and turn into cells or become stored energy. The energy your body needs in order to stay healthy and alive is directly related to the number of calories you intake (eat). The inverse is also true, too many calories consumed can lead to weight problems and poor health.

You can determine how many calories you need through a variety of factors. Every individual will differ depending on what their body needs to stay balanced. There are several ways that you can find out how many calories you need each day. This can also help in determining the types of foods that you need to eat. These can then be balanced with the nutrients that your body needs, such as vitamins and minerals. These can provide an extra boost for your energy burning needs.
