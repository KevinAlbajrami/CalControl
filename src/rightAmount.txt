Too Many Overall Calories
Extreme calorie restriction affects your health and your ability to lose weight. Low calorie intake reduces the amount of food you can eat and may prevent you from getting all necessary nutrients. Research shows that calorie restriction reduces leptin, a hormone that helps to regulate appetite. Low levels of leptin can lead to hunger and overeating. Research also shows that low-calorie dieting increases stress and the release of the stress hormone, cortisol. As a result of this stress response, the body conserves energy and the metabolism slows to combat the risk of starvation. While you might think that drastically cutting calories is sure to result in weight loss, these changes in stress levels are actually associated with weight gain.

Too Many Overall Calories
Weight gain is a major effect of eating too many calories. Your body needs enough calories to function, but when you take in more than your body uses, it stores the excess calories in the form of fat. Extra calories are mainly stored in the form of triglycerides, which, when elevated, places your heart health at risk. As with other lipids, too many triglycerides accumulate in your arteries, increasing the risk of your arteries becoming hard, stiff and narrow -- a condition known as atherosclerosis. Stiffening of the artery wall increases the risk of having a heart attack or stroke.
Once you're overweight, the risk for fatty liver disease, certain cancers and high blood pressure increases. It also increases the pressure on your joints, raising the risk of osteoarthritis. The extra fat surrounding your neck can cause breathing problems and lead to sleep apnea, a condition in which you stop breathing temporarily while asleep.
