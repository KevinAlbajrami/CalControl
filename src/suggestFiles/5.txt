Step away from the nuts.
 Especially if they're in a big bowl. The bigger the serving bowl, the more you'll eat, Cornell University researchers say.
Nuts have heart-healthy fats, but they're also high in calories: 1 handful (about 1 ounce) of oil-roasted mixed nuts has 175 calories; 3 handfuls have 525. Cut out nuts altogether and save more than 500 calories.
Can't resist 'em? Eat pistachios: 2 handfuls are just 159 calories, and the shelling will slow down your munching.
