Beware hidden oils.
 Ask to have your food cooked with a little stock instead of oil, or order steamed or poached entrees: you'll save 124 calories per tablespoon of oil.
Also, have the kitchen skip oils added at the last minute like basil oil or chive oil, and save another 40 calories per teaspoon.
