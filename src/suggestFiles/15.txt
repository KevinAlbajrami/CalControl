Beware the healthy-food trap.
 People let their guard down when the menu is full of healthy fare, underestimating calories by as much as 35%, research by the Cornell University Food and Brand Lab shows.
You're also more likely to order drinks, sides, and desserts with up to 131% more calories when you have a healthy entree. Skip caloric sides: a cookie, chips to save 500-plus calories.
