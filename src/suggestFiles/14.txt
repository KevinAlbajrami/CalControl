Nix that smoothie a day.
 A large 32-ounce smoothie can have 800 or more calories. That really adds up if you're having on-the-go breakfast several times a week.
Instead, try a filling lower-calorie starter of oatmeal with brown sugar and banana slices, and a cup of black coffee. You'll save 518 calories.
